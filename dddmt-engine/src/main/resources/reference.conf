#Default (empty) config objects for plugin entity types.
#Note: DO NOT modify this file when adding plugin entity types. Instead, create a new one in the root of your
# plugin jar, name it reference.conf, copy this skeleton there, and add entities following this format:
#
# <id> : "<full-java-class-name>"
# 
# <id> must match that of <full-java-class-name>, or an exception is thrown.
#Note that standard entity types (those found in std package) are not supposed to be listed here, as 
#they are handled internally
